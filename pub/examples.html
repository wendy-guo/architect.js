        <p>Hello architect! This is a javascript library designed to facilitate the rendering of 3D block objects, without needing knowledge of WebGL. It comes
            built-in with many animations for your objects, but you also have the freedom of defining your own custom ones! Architect.js can be used to build scenes used for games, maps, or just fun little animations to sprinkle in on any website.</p>

        <h1>structure examples</h1>
        <p>The Block objects can be tailored to create any building your imagination renders! Combine blocks of varying sizes and assemble to create a landscape of structures. Theey can be used to build game worlds, a 3D map, an animated story, and more! Below is an example; a small group of structures that is animated to rotate. </p>

        <h1>blocks grid examples</h1>
        <p>The animated "architect" header at the top of the page was created using the BlocksGrid 
        object! This object stores an array of Block objects of the same dimension.
        It allows for easy manipulation of a collection of blocks that come together to form stunning
        visuals. The library comes with several preset animations, but you are free to make your own! 
        Below are some other animation examples. It can be used to animated pixel art, pixel text, or 
        anything else you want!</p>
