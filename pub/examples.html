    <h1>Blocks Grid Examples</h1>

    <p>the animated architect.js header at the top of the page was created using the BlocksGrid object! 
        It allows for easy manipulation of a collection of blocks that come together to form stunning 
        visuals. The library comes with several preset animations, but you are free to make your own! 
    </p>
