    <h1>about</h1>

    <p>hello architect! this is a javascript library designed to facilitate the rendering of 3D block objects. it comes built-in with many animations for your objects.... blah blah...</p>

    // example structures that can be built
    <h1>structure examples</h1>

    // show those structures rotating and translating and scaling
    <h1>Blocks Grid Examples</h1>

    <p>the animated architect.js header at the top of the page was created using the BlocksGrid object! 
        It allows for easy manipulation of a collection of blocks that come together to form stunning 
        visuals. The library comes with several preset animations, but you are free to make your own! 
    </p>

    // show grid blocks with wave animations
