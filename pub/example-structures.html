            <p>The Block objects can be tailored to create any building your imagination renders! Combine blocks of varying
                sizes and assemble to create a landscape of structures. Theey can be used to build game worlds, a 3D map, an
                animated story, and more! Below is an example; a small group of structures that is animated to rotate. </p>

            <h1>blocks grid examples</h1>
            <p>The animated "architect" header at the top of the page was created using the BlocksGrid
                object! This object stores an array of Block objects of the same dimension.
                It allows for easy manipulation of a collection of blocks that come together to form stunning
                visuals. The library comes with several preset animations, but you are free to make your own!
                Below are some other animation examples. It can be used to animated pixel art, pixel text, or
                anything else you want!</p>
